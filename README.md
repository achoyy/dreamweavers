You are a ghost, who lives inside of people's dreams! Currently, you're inside the dream of a girl named Annie. Your goal is to make sure everything goes smoothly, and everything is alright! To do this, you see into what's going to happen in the near future, go back in time and change something. (Currently has 3 "stages")
